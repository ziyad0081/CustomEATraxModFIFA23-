# Custom EA Trax Mod for FIFA 23

This mod replaces two original FIFA 23 EA Trax songs and their cover art with custom tracks and thumbnails, inspired by **179WEST's USM Mod for FC24**.

---

## Overview
Using **FIFA Editor Tool (FET)**, this mod:
- Replaces in-game songs and their cover art.
- Adds the necessary song segments to the EA Trax database.
- Provides a ready-to-use `.fifamod` file compatible with **FIFA Mod Manager**.

## Track Changes
It's worth noting this mod was just me experimenting with modding FF23 and so I didn't add many titles
| Original Track (EA Trax) | Replaced With |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Behind The Sun ** -  *ODEZA* | **Maman j'ai mal** ‚Äì *MHD* |
| **you should see me in a crown** - *Billie Eilish* | **√áa d√©pend** ‚Äì *Flenn ft. SYC* |
